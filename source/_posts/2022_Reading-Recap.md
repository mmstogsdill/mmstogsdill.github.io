In 2022 I set out to reach my goal of reading 10 books before the end of the year. Although I fell a bit short of that goal I still had some great reads. 

## What I read in 2022


- **Doctor Sleep**, Stephen King
- **Anthem**, Ayn Rend
- **IT**, Stephen King
- **Atomic Habits**, James Clear
- **Dune**, Frank Herbert
- **Insomnia**, Stephen King
- **Needful Things**, Stephen King
- **Can't Hurt Me**, David Goggins

## What I read in 2021

Since there isn't a 2021 Reading Recap here is what I read in 2021.

- **The Shining**, Stephen King
- **1984**, George Orwell
- **Living with a Seal**, Jesse Itzler
- **The Subtle Art of not Giving a F*ck**, Mark Manson

I definitely didn't get to read as much as I set out to do but it was still a great year. I've moved closer to my goal of reading every Stephen King novel with the addition of Doctor Sleep, IT, Insomnia, and Needful Things and have a lot more on my plate for 2023. 

### Favorite Book of 2022

My favorite this year definitely had to be **Can't Hurt Me** by David Goggins. I was introduced to Goggins when a friend let me borrow **Living with a Seal** by Jesse Itzler and I later found that Goggins had written his own book. **Can't Hurt Me** tells Goggins lifetime of struggle and rise to the toughest man on planet Earth as he becomes the first and only member of the US Armed Forces to complete SEAL training, Army Ranger School, and Air Force Tactical Air Controller training. Goggins philosphy is that you can achieve anything you put your mind to and most of us don't even tap into half of what our minds and bodies are capable of. Goggins story is inspiring to anyone who's looking to see what it means for a human to push himself above and beyond his limits and I'm excited to see what he reveals in his upcoming book **Never Finished** in 2023.
