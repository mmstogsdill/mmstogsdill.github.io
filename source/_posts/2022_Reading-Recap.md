## What I read in 2021

Since there isn't a 2021 Reading Recap here is what I read in 2021.

- **The Shining**, Stephen King
- **1984**, George Orwell
- **Living with a Seal**, Jesse Itzler
- **The Subtle Art of not Giving a F*ck**, Mark Manson

Although I didn't manage to read as much as I had initially planned, it was still a remarkable year. I made progress towards my goal of reading every Stephen King novel, and in 2022, I added **Doctor Sleep**, **IT**, **Insomnia**, and **Needful Things** to my list. Looking forward, my reading list for 2023 is already brimming with exciting titles.

### Favorite Book of 2022

Among all the books I read this year, **Can’t Hurt Me** by David Goggins stood out as an absolute favorite. My introduction to Goggins came when a friend lent me **Living with a Seal** by Jesse Itzler, and through that, I discovered Goggins' own compelling story. **Can’t Hurt Me** narrates Goggins' lifetime of struggles and his extraordinary journey to becoming the toughest man on the planet. His achievements include being the first and only member of the US Armed Forces to complete SEAL training, Army Ranger School, and Air Force Tactical Air Controller training. Goggins' philosophy revolves around the idea that we have the power to achieve anything we set our minds to, often failing to tap into even half of our mental and physical potential. His story is incredibly inspiring, particularly for those seeking to understand the depths to which a human can push themselves beyond perceived limits. Excitement is building within me as I eagerly anticipate his upcoming book, **Never Finished**, scheduled for release in 2023. I can't wait to uncover more of his insights and wisdom.
