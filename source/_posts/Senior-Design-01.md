This semester I completed the first course of Senior Design at the University of Iowa. The course split us into teams where my team and I were able to put into practice everything we've learned the last three years with our degree. The course assigns three different Electrical/Computer Engineering projects that end with each team producing a final product.

# Project 1 - Digital Thermometer with Web Interface





# Project 2 - Electric Eye Safety System





# Project 3 - Polling Website UI/UX Design
